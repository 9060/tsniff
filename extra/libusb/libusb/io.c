 * \page io Synchronous and asynchronous device I/O
 *
 * \section intro Introduction
 *
 * If you're using libusb in your application, you're probably wanting to
 * perform I/O with devices - you want to perform USB data transfers.
 *
 * libusb offers two separate interfaces for device I/O. This page aims to
 * introduce the two in order to help you decide which one is more suitable
 * for your application. You can also choose to use both interfaces in your
 * application by considering each transfer on a case-by-case basis.
 *
 * Once you have read through the following discussion, you should consult the
 * detailed API documentation pages for the details:
 * - \ref syncio
 * - \ref asyncio
 *
 * \section theory Transfers at a logical level
 *
 * At a logical level, USB transfers typically happen in two parts. For
 * example, when reading data from a endpoint:
 * -# A request for data is sent to the device
 * -# Some time later, the incoming data is received by the host
 *
 * or when writing data to an endpoint:
 *
 * -# The data is sent to the device
 * -# Some time later, the host receives acknowledgement from the device that
 *    the data has been transferred.
 *
 * There may be an indefinite delay between the two steps. Consider a
 * fictional USB input device with a button that the user can press. In order
 * to determine when the button is pressed, you would likely submit a request
 * to read data on a bulk or interrupt endpoint and wait for data to arrive.
 * Data will arrive when the button is pressed by the user, which is
 * potentially hours later.
 *
 * libusb offers both a synchronous and an asynchronous interface to performing
 * USB transfers. The main difference is that the synchronous interface
 * combines both steps indicated above into a single function call, whereas
 * the asynchronous interface separates them.
 *
 * \section sync The synchronous interface
 *
 * The synchronous I/O interface allows you to perform a USB transfer with
 * a single function call. When the function call returns, the transfer has
 * completed and you can parse the results.
 *
 * If you have used the libusb-0.1 before, this I/O style will seem familar to
 * you. libusb-0.1 only offered a synchronous interface.
 *
 * In our input device example, to read button presses you might write code
 * in the following style:
\code
unsigned char data[4];
int actual_length,
int r = libusb_bulk_transfer(handle, EP_IN, data, sizeof(data), &actual_length, 0);
if (r == 0 && actual_length == sizeof(data)) {
	// results of the transaction can now be found in the data buffer
	// parse them here and report button press
} else {
	error();
}
\endcode
 *
 * The main advantage of this model is simplicity: you did everything with
 * a single simple function call.
 *
 * However, this interface has its limitations. Your application will sleep
 * inside libusb_bulk_transfer() until the transaction has completed. If it
 * takes the user 3 hours to press the button, your application will be
 * sleeping for that long. Execution will be tied up inside the library -
 * the entire thread will be useless for that duration.
 *
 * Another issue is that by tieing up the thread with that single transaction
 * there is no possibility of performing I/O with multiple endpoints and/or
 * multiple devices simultaneously, unless you resort to creating one thread
 * per transaction.
 *
 * Additionally, there is no opportunity to cancel the transfer after the
 * request has been submitted.
 *
 * For details on how to use the synchronous API, see the
 * \ref syncio "synchronous I/O API documentation" pages.
 * 
 * \section async The asynchronous interface
 *
 * Asynchronous I/O is the most significant new feature in libusb-1.0.
 * Although it is a more complex interface, it solves all the issues detailed
 * above.
 *
 * Instead of providing which functions that block until the I/O has complete,
 * libusb's asynchronous interface presents non-blocking functions which
 * begin a transfer and then return immediately. Your application passes a
 * callback function pointer to this non-blocking function, which libusb will
 * call with the results of the transaction when it has completed.
 *
 * Transfers which have been submitted through the non-blocking functions
 * can be cancelled with a separate function call.
 *
 * The non-blocking nature of this interface allows you to be simultaneously
 * performing I/O to multiple endpoints on multiple devices, without having
 * to use threads.
 *
 * This added flexibility does come with some complications though:
 * - In the interest of being a lightweight library, libusb does not create
 * threads and can only operate when your application is calling into it. Your
 * application must call into libusb from it's main loop when events are ready
 * to be handled, or you must use some other scheme to allow libusb to
 * undertake whatever work needs to be done.
 * - libusb also needs to be called into at certain fixed points in time in
 * order to accurately handle transfer timeouts.
 * - Memory handling becomes more complex. You cannot use stack memory unless
 * the function with that stack is guaranteed not to return until the transfer
 * callback has finished executing.
 * - You generally lose some linearity from your code flow because submitting
 * the transfer request is done in a separate function from where the transfer
 * results are handled. This becomes particularly obvious when you want to
 * submit a second transfer based on the results of an earlier transfer.
 *
 * Internally, libusb's synchronous interface is expressed in terms of function
 * calls to the asynchronous interface.
 *
 * For details on how to use the asynchronous API, see the
 * \ref asyncio "asynchronous I/O API" documentation pages.
 */

/**
 * @defgroup asyncio Asynchronous device I/O
 *
 * This page details libusb's asynchronous (non-blocking) API for USB device
 * I/O. This interface is very powerful but is also quite complex - you will
 * need to read this page carefully to understand the necessary considerations
 * and issues surrounding use of this interface. Simplistic applications
 * may wish to consider the \ref syncio "synchronous I/O API" instead.
 *
 * The asynchronous interface is built around the idea of separating transfer
 * submission and handling of transfer completion (the synchronous model
 * combines both of these into one). There may be a long delay between
 * submission and completion, however the asynchronous submission function
 * is non-blocking so will return control to your application during that
 * potentially long delay.
 *
 * \section asyncabstraction Transfer abstraction
 *
 * For the asynchronous I/O, libusb implements the concept of a generic
 * transfer entity for all types of I/O (control, bulk, interrupt,
 * isochronous). The generic transfer object must be treated slightly
 * differently depending on which type of I/O you are performing with it.
 *
 * This is represented by the public libusb_transfer structure type.
 *
 * \section asynctrf Asynchronous transfers
 *
 * We can view asynchronous I/O as a 5 step process:
 * -# Allocation
 * -# Filling
 * -# Submission
 * -# Completion handling
 * -# Deallocation
 *
 * \subsection asyncalloc Allocation
 *
 * This step involves allocating memory for a USB transfer. This is the
 * generic transfer object mentioned above. At this stage, the transfer
 * is "blank" with no details about what type of I/O it will be used for.
 *
 * Allocation is done with the libusb_alloc_transfer() function. It is also
 * possible to allocate your own libusb_transfer structure, but only if you
 * take the following into account:
 * -# For implementation reasons, the memory allocated for the transfer must
 * actually be larger than sizeof(struct libusb_transfer). If you wish to
 * allocate your own transfers, you must allocate them with the size
 * determined by libusb_get_transfer_alloc_size().
 * -# After allocating space for a transfer, you must initialize it with
 * libusb_init_transfer().
 *
 * \subsection asyncfill Filling
 *
 * This step is where you take a previously allocated transfer and fill it
 * with information to determine the message type and direction, data buffer,
 * callback function, etc.
 *
 * You can either fill the required fields yourself or you can use the
 * helper functions: libusb_fill_control_transfer(), libusb_fill_bulk_transfer()
 * and libusb_fill_interrupt_transfer().
 *
 * \subsection asyncsubmit Submission
 *
 * When you have allocated a transfer and filled it, you can submit it using
 * libusb_submit_transfer(). This function returns immediately but can be
 * regarded as firing off the I/O request in the background.
 *
 * \subsection asynccomplete Completion handling
 *
 * After a transfer has been submitted, one of four things can happen to it:
 *
 * - The transfer completes (i.e. some data was transferred)
 * - The transfer has a timeout and the timeout expires before all data is
 * transferred
 * - The transfer fails due to an error
 * - The transfer is cancelled
 *
 * Each of these will cause the user-specified transfer callback function to
 * be invoked. It is up to the callback function to determine which of the
 * above actually happened and to act accordingly.
 *
 * \subsection Deallocation
 *
 * When a transfer has completed (i.e. the callback function has been invoked),
 * you are advised to free the transfer (unless you wish to resubmit it, see
 * below).
 *
 * If you allocated the transfer with libusb_alloc_transfer(), deallocate it
 * with libusb_free_transfer(). If you're using your own memory management
 * scheme, free it through your scheme.
 *
 * It is undefined behaviour to free a transfer which has not completed.
 *
 * \section asyncresubmit Resubmission
 *
 * You may be wondering why allocation, filling, and submission are all
 * separated above where they could reasonably be combined into a single
 * operation.
 *
 * The reason for separation is to allow you to resubmit transfers without
 * having to allocate new ones every time. This is especially useful for
 * common situations dealing with interrupt endpoints - you allocate one
 * transfer, fill and submit it, and when it returns with results you just
 * resubmit it for the next interrupt.
 *
 * \section asynccancel Cancellation
 *
 * Another advantage of using the asynchronous interface is that you have
 * the ability to cancel transfers which have not yet completed. This is
 * done by calling the libusb_cancel_transfer() function.
 *
 * libusb_cancel_transfer() is asynchronous/non-blocking in itself. When the
 * cancellation actually completes, the transfer's callback function will
 * be invoked, and the callback function should check the transfer status to
 * determine that it was cancelled.
 *
 * Freeing the transfer after it has been cancelled but before cancellation
 * has completed will result in undefined behaviour.
 *
 * \section asyncctrl Considerations for control transfers
 *
 * The <tt>libusb_transfer</tt> structure is generic and hence does not
 * include specific fields for the control-specific setup packet structure.
 *
 * In order to perform a control transfer, you must place the 8-byte setup
 * packet at the start of the data buffer. To simplify this, you could
 * cast the buffer pointer to type struct libusb_control_setup, or you can
 * use the helper function libusb_fill_control_setup().
 *
 * The wLength field placed in the setup packet must be the length you would
 * expect to be sent in the setup packet: the length of the payload that
 * follows (or the expected maximum number of bytes to receive). However,
 * the length field of the libusb_transfer object must be the length of
 * the data buffer - i.e. it should be wLength <em>plus</em> the size of
 * the setup packet (LIBUSB_CONTROL_SETUP_SIZE).
 *
 * If you use the helper functions, this is simplified for you:
 * -# Allocate a buffer of size LIBUSB_CONTROL_SETUP_SIZE plus the size of the
 * data you are sending/requesting.
 * -# Call libusb_fill_control_setup() on the data buffer, using the transfer
 * request size as the wLength value (i.e. do not include the extra space you
 * allocated for the control setup).
 * -# If this is a host-to-device transfer, place the data to be transferred
 * in the data buffer, starting at offset LIBUSB_CONTROL_SETUP_SIZE.
 * -# Call libusb_fill_control_transfer() to associate the data buffer with
 * the transfer (and to set the remaining details such as callback and timeout).
 *   - Note that there is no parameter to set the length field of the transfer.
 *     The length is automatically inferred from the wLength field of the setup
 *     packet.
 * -# Submit the transfer.
 *
 * Further considerations are needed when handling transfer completion in
 * your callback function:
 * - As you might expect, the setup packet will still be sitting at the start
 * of the data buffer.
 * - If this was a device-to-host transfer, the received data will be sitting
 * at offset LIBUSB_CONTROL_SETUP_SIZE into the buffer.
 * - The actual_length field of the transfer structure is relative to the
 * wLength of the setup packet, rather than the size of the data buffer. So,
 * if your wLength was 4, your transfer's <tt>length</tt> was 12, then you
 * should expect an <tt>actual_length</tt> of 4 to indicate that the data was
 * transferred in entirity.
 *
 * To simplify parsing of setup packets and obtaining the data from the
 * correct offset, you may wish to use the libusb_control_transfer_get_data()
 * and libusb_control_transfer_get_setup() functions within your transfer
 * callback.
 *
 * \section asyncmem Memory caveats
 *
 * In most circumstances, it is not safe to use stack memory for transfer
 * buffers. This is because the function that fired off the asynchronous
 * transfer may return before libusb has finished using the buffer, and when
 * the function returns it's stack gets destroyed. This is true for both
 * host-to-device and device-to-host transfers.
 *
 * The only case in which it is safe to use stack memory is where you can
 * guarantee that the function owning the stack space for the buffer does not
 * return until after the transfer's callback function has completed. In every
 * other case, you need to use heap memory instead.
 *
 * \section asyncflags Fine control
 *
 * Through using this asynchronous interface, you may find yourself repeating
 * a few simple operations many times. You can apply a bitwise OR of certain
 * flags to a transfer to simplify certain things:
 * - \ref libusb_transfer_flags::LIBUSB_TRANSFER_SHORT_NOT_OK
 *   "LIBUSB_TRANSFER_SHORT_NOT_OK" results in transfers which transferred
 *   less than the requested amount of data being marked with status
 *   \ref libusb_transfer_status::LIBUSB_TRANSFER_ERROR "LIBUSB_TRANSFER_ERROR"
 *   (they would normally be regarded as COMPLETED)
 * - \ref libusb_transfer_flags::LIBUSB_TRANSFER_FREE_BUFFER
 *   "LIBUSB_TRANSFER_FREE_BUFFER" allows you to ask libusb to free the transfer
 *   buffer when freeing the transfer.
 * - \ref libusb_transfer_flags::LIBUSB_TRANSFER_FREE_TRANSFER
 *   "LIBUSB_TRANSFER_FREE_TRANSFER" causes libusb to automatically free the
 *   transfer after the transfer callback returns.
 *
 * \section asyncevent Event handling
 *
 * In accordance of the aim of being a lightweight library, libusb does not
 * create threads internally. This means that libusb code does not execute
 * at any time other than when your application is calling a libusb function.
 * However, an asynchronous model requires that libusb perform work at various
 * points in time - namely processing the results of previously-submitted
 * transfers and invoking the user-supplied callback function.
 *
 * This gives rise to the libusb_poll() function which your
 * application must call into when libusb has work do to. This gives libusb
 * the opportunity to reap pending transfers, invoke callbacks, etc.
 *
 * The first issue to discuss here is how your application can figure out
 * when libusb has work to do. In fact, there are two naive options which
 * do not actually require your application to know this:
 * -# Periodically call libusb_poll() in non-blocking mode at fixed short
 *  intervals from your main loop
 * -# Repeatedly call libusb_poll() in blocking mode from a dedicated thread.
 *
 * The first option is plainly not very nice, and will cause unnecessary 
 * CPU wakeups leading to increased power usage and decreased battery life.
 * The second option is not very nice either, but may be the nicest option
 * available to you if the "proper" approach can not be applied to your
 * application (read on...).
 * 
 * The recommended option is to integrate libusb with your application main
 * event loop. libusb exposes a set of file descriptors which allow you to do
 * this. Your main loop is probably already calling poll() or select() or a
 * variant on a set of file descriptors for other event sources (e.g. keyboard
 * button presses, mouse movements, network sockets, etc). You then add
 * libusb's file descriptors to your poll()/select() calls, and when activity
 * is detected on such descriptors you know it is time to call
 * libusb_poll().
 *
 * There is one final event handling complication. libusb supports
 * asynchronous transfers which time out after a specified time period, and
 * this requires that libusb is called into at or after the timeout so that
 * the timeout can be handled. So, in addition to considering libusb's file
 * descriptors in your main event loop, you must also consider that libusb
 * sometimes needs to be called into at fixed points in time even when there
 * is no file descriptor activity.
 *
 * For the details on retrieving the set of file descriptors and determining
 * the next timeout, see the \ref poll "polling and timing" API documentation.
 */

/**
 * @defgroup poll Polling and timing
 *
 * This page documents libusb's functions for polling events and timing.
 * These functions are only necessary for users of the
 * \ref asyncio "asynchronous API". If you are only using the simpler
 * \ref syncio "synchronous API" then you do not need to ever call these
 * functions.
 *
 * The justification for the functionality described here has already been
 * discussed in the \ref asyncevent "event handling" section of the
 * asynchronous API documentation. In summary, libusb does not create internal
 * threads for event processing and hence relies on your application calling
 * into libusb at certain points in time so that pending events can be handled.
 * In order to know precisely when libusb needs to be called into, libusb
 * offers you a set of pollable file descriptors and information about when
 * the next timeout expires.
 *
 * If you are using the asynchronous I/O API, you must take one of the two
 * following options, otherwise your I/O will not complete.
 *
 * \section pollsimple The simple option
 *
 * If your application revolves solely around libusb and does not need to
 * handle other event sources, you can have a program structure as follows:
\code
// initialize libusb
// find and open device
// maybe fire off some initial async I/O

while (user_has_not_requested_exit)
	libusb_poll();

// clean up and exit
\endcode
 *
 * With such a simple main loop, you do not have to worry about managing
 * sets of file descriptors or handling timeouts. libusb_poll() will handle
 * those details internally.
 *
 * \section pollmain The more advanced option
 *
 * In more advanced applications, you will already have a main loop which
 * is monitoring other event sources: network sockets, X11 events, mouse
 * movements, etc. Through exposing a set of file descriptors, libusb is
 * designed to cleanly integrate into such main loops.
 *
 * In addition to polling file descriptors for the other event sources, you
 * take a set of file descriptors from libusb and monitor those too. When you
 * detect activity on libusb's file descriptors, you call libusb_poll_timeout()
 * in non-blocking mode.
 *
 * You must also consider the fact that libusb sometimes has to handle events
 * at certain known times which do not generate activity on file descriptors.
 * Your main loop must also consider these times, modify it's poll()/select()
 * timeout accordingly, and track time so that libusb_poll_timeout() is called
 * in non-blocking mode when timeouts expire.
 *
 * In pseudo-code, you want something that looks like:
\code
// initialise libusb

libusb_get_pollfds()
while (user has not requested application exit):
	libusb_get_next_timeout()
	select(on libusb file descriptors plus any other event sources of interest,
		using a timeout no larger than the value libusb just suggested)
	if (select() indicated activity on libusb file descriptors):
		libusb_poll_timeout(0);
	if (time has elapsed to or beyond the libusb timeout):
		libusb_poll_timeout(0);
 
// clean up and exit
\endcode
 *
 * The set of file descriptors that libusb uses as event sources may change
 * during the life of your application. Rather than having to repeatedly
 * call libusb_get_pollfds(), you can set up notification functions for when
 * the file descriptor set changes using libusb_set_pollfd_notifiers().
 *
